# TT-CV
Two page academic CV template heavily adapted from the popular [Deedy Resume](https://github.com/deedydas/Deedy-Resume)

Easiest way to adapt this -- download the git repo to your local storage, upload it as a new project to an [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) account, adapt it and compile it using XeLaTeX.
